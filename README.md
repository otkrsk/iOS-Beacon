# iOS Beacon
*iOS Beacon* is a simple iOS application that allows your iPhone or iPad to broadcast as an iBeacon. Great for testing and developing iBeacon applications, if you have a spare iPhone/iPad lying around.

There were a lot of other iBeacon broadcasting sample applications, but many were outdated and had a lot of issues when trying to compile. This one is pretty straightforward with no bells or whistles. Just an application that acts as a broadcasting agent.

You will still need an app that will receive the broadcast, and there is a couple out there that works (for me, at least).
