# Make Your iOS Device into an iBeacon
*iOS Beacon* is a simple iOS application that allows your iPhone or iPad to broadcast as an iBeacon. Great for testing and developing iBeacon applications, if you have a spare iPhone/iPad lying around.

There were a lot of other iBeacon broadcasting sample applications, but many were outdated and had a lot of issues when trying to compile. This one is pretty straightforward with no bells or whistles. Just an application that acts as a broadcasting agent.

You will still need an app that will receive the broadcast, and there is a couple out there that works (for me, at least). [Beacon Scanner by Matt Nedrich](https://github.com/mattnedrich/beacon-scanner) is the one I'm using. You can read his guide on interacting with iBeacons in iOS using Swift [here](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/01/31/ibeacon-in-swift/).
